## Organization

You should check the next files following the order indicated: 
 - public/index.hmtl
 - src/index.js
 - src/App.js

## index.html
This HTML file is a template.
    If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

    You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
    The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

    To begin the development, run 'npm start'.
    To create a production bundle, use 'npm run build'.

## index.js
This JS file will execute the components you indicate inside 'root.render()"
    You have to type there the component 'App' in order to provide the application the component called 'App' is going to stored all the components inside itself.

## App.js
This is where you have to deal whith the organization of all the components. The best way to manage them is organized them one inside of anothers, thus you can go from the smallest component to a bigger one (which is basically a repetition of the smallest component).
